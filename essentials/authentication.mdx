# Authentication

All API requests to Ödeal Payment Infrastructure require authentication using API keys.

## API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate your requests. Each merchant account has unique API credentials:

- **API Key**: Used in the `X-API-Key` header
- **Merchant ID**: Your unique merchant identifier

<Warning>
Never share your API keys publicly. Treat them like passwords and store them securely.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in every request header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.odeal.com/v1/payments \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "merchantId": "your_merchant_id",
    "amount": {
      "amount": 100.00,
      "currency": "TRY"
    }
  }'
```

## Required Headers

| Header | Description | Required |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `X-API-Key` | Your API authentication key | Yes |
| `X-Idempotency-Key` | UUID v4 for idempotent requests | Yes (POST/PUT/DELETE) |
| `Content-Type` | Must be `application/json` | Yes (POST/PUT) |
| `X-Correlation-ID` | Optional request tracking ID | No |

## Test vs Production Keys

We provide separate API keys for testing and production:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Test Environment
X-API-Key: test_sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

```bash Production Environment
X-API-Key: live_sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Test keys start with `test_` and production keys start with `live_`
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables, never hardcode them in your source code.
    
    ```bash
    export ODEAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    Contact support to rotate your API keys periodically for enhanced security.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS Only">
    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. HTTP requests will be rejected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implement IP Whitelisting">
    Contact support to whitelist specific IP addresses for additional security.
  </Accordion>
