## Integration & Development

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle webhooks?">
    Webhooks notify your server about payment events in real-time.
    
    **Setup**:
    1. Create an endpoint (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/webhooks/odeal`)
    2. Register it in your dashboard or via API
    3. Verify webhook signatures for security
    4. Return 200 OK quickly (< 5 seconds)
    5. Process asynchronously if needed
    
    See our [Webhook Guide](/guides/webhooks) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's idempotency and why is it important?">
    **Idempotency** ensures duplicate requests don't create duplicate charges.
    
    Always send `X-Idempotency-Key` header:
    
    ```bash
    X-Idempotency-Key: order-12345-1640000000
    ```
    
    - Use unique key per payment (e.g., order ID + timestamp)
    - If request fails and you retry, use same key
    - Prevents accidental duplicate charges
    - Required for payment creation and critical operations
    
    See [Idempotency Guide](/essentials/idempotency) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle errors?">
    All API errors return:
    - HTTP status code (400, 401, 404, 500, etc.)
    - Error code (e.g., `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`)
    - Human-readable message
    - Request ID for debugging
    
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "CARD_DECLINED",
        "message": "The card was declined",
        "requestId": "req_abc123"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    See [Error Reference](/api-reference/errors) for all error codes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits?">
    Yes, to ensure fair usage and system stability:
    
    - **Default**: 1000 requests per minute per merchant
    - **Burst**: Up to 2000 requests per minute for 30 seconds
    
    Rate limit headers in every response:
    ```
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 847
    X-RateLimit-Reset: 1703001600
    ```
    
    Higher limits available for Enterprise customers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I save cards for future payments?">
    Yes! Use the `saveCard: true` option when creating a payment:
    
    ```javascript
    {
      "merchantId": "merchant-123",
      "amount": 100.00,
      "customerId": "customer-abc",
      "saveCard": true
    }
    ```
    
    You'll receive a `cardToken` that you can use for future charges.
    
    **Important**:
    - You must have customer consent
    - Comply with GDPR/KVKK for stored data
    - Tokens are single-use by default
    - Use tokenization instead of storing raw card data
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Marketplace & Split Payments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does the marketplace model work?">
    Ödeal uses the **Payment Facilitator (PF)** model:
    
    1. **Platform** (you) creates account with Ödeal
    2. **Sub-merchants** (sellers) onboard through your platform
    3. **Payments** go through platform's merchant account
    4. **Funds** automatically split between platform and sellers
    5. **Settlement** to each party's bank account
    
    Benefits:
    - Simple onboarding for sellers
    - Full control over user experience
    - Flexible commission structures
    - Compliance handled by Ödeal
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I have unlimited sub-merchants?">
    Yes! Our recursive sub-merchant model supports:
    - Unlimited number of sub-merchants
    - Unlimited hierarchy depth (sub-merchants of sub-merchants)
    - Flexible commission structures at each level
    
    Perfect for:
    - Multi-level marketplaces
    - White-label platforms
    - Franchise models
    - Agency networks
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How are commissions calculated?">
    Commissions can be:
    - **Percentage-based**: X% of transaction (e.g., 15%)
    - **Fixed fee**: Flat amount per transaction (e.g., 5 TRY)
    - **Hybrid**: Combination of both
    
    Set per merchant during onboarding:
    
    ```javascript
    {
      "commissionConfig": {
        "platformCommissionRate": 0.15, // 15%
        "platformFixedFee": 0.50 // 0.50 TRY
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Funds automatically split during settlement.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does sub-merchant verification work?">
    Sub-merchants go through KYC verification:
    
    1. **Information Collection**: Business details, tax ID, bank account
    2. **Document Upload**: Business license, ID, bank statement
    3. **Verification**: Automated + manual review (1-3 days)
    4. **Approval**: Merchant can start accepting payments
    
    **Required documents**:
    - Business registration
    - Tax certificate
    - ID of authorized person
    - Bank account proof
    
    We handle compliance burden - you focus on your platform.

    Common reasons:
    
    1. **Card declined** by bank (insufficient funds, fraud detection)

    4. **3DS authentication failed**
    5. **Network timeout**

    Check the error code and message in the response. See [Troubleshooting Guide](/troubleshooting/payment-failures) for solutions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Webhooks aren't being delivered. What should I do?">
    **Troubleshooting steps**:
    
    1. Check endpoint is publicly accessible (not localhost)
    2. Verify SSL certificate is valid
    3. Ensure endpoint returns 200 OK within 5 seconds
    4. Check webhook signature verification
    5. Review webhook logs in dashboard
    
    See [Webhook Debugging Guide](/troubleshooting/webhook-debugging) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How can I test 3D Secure?">
    In test environment:

    2. API will return `status: "REQUIRES_3DS"` with `threeDSecureUrl`
    3. Redirect user to that URL
    4. Test authentication page will appear
    5. Click "Authenticate" to succeed or "Cancel" to fail
    6. Handle callback with verification result
